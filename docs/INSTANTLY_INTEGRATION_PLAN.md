# Instantly.ai Integration Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Status:** Research Complete - Ready for Build Planning
**Purpose:** Integrate Instantly.ai email sending platform with existing lead generation system

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Overview
This document synthesizes research findings and provides a comprehensive integration plan for connecting the existing lead generation platform with Instantly.ai's email campaign automation service. The integration will transform the platform from a lead generation tool into a complete end-to-end outreach system.

### Current State
- **Lead Generation Platform:** Scrapes businesses from Google Maps, enriches with Facebook/LinkedIn data
- **Email Enrichment:** Collects and verifies emails through multiple sources (Google Maps, Facebook, LinkedIn, Bouncer)
- **AI Enhancement:** Generates personalized icebreakers and subject lines using OpenAI
- **Export Capability:** CSV export with enriched data
- **Gap:** No email sending capability - users must manually import CSV into email tools

### Target State
- **Seamless Integration:** One-click export from campaigns directly to Instantly.ai
- **Automated Campaign Creation:** Automatically create Instantly.ai campaigns from lead gen campaigns
- **Real-time Tracking:** Monitor email engagement (opens, replies, clicks) within the platform
- **Closed-loop Analytics:** Track ROI from scraping → enrichment → email → response
- **Two-way Sync:** Pull response data back into Supabase for unified analytics

### Key Benefits
1. **Eliminate Manual Export:** No more CSV downloads and manual imports
2. **Faster Time-to-Outreach:** From lead generation to email sent in minutes
3. **Better Analytics:** Track complete funnel from scrape to reply
4. **Higher Conversion:** Personalized icebreakers + verified emails + automated sending
5. **Competitive Advantage:** End-to-end solution in one platform

## 2. Recommended Integration Approach

### Architecture Pattern: **Hybrid Sync with Webhook Notifications**

**Why This Pattern:**
- **Push on Demand:** User triggers export → immediately creates Instantly campaign
- **Pull on Schedule:** Periodic polling for campaign analytics updates
- **Real-time Events:** Webhook notifications for email responses (opens, replies, clicks)
- **Resilience:** Polling provides backup if webhooks fail
- **User Control:** Explicit opt-in for each campaign export

## 8. Architecture Considerations

### 8.1 Database Schema Design

**New Tables:**

```sql
-- 1. Instantly API Keys (encrypted)
CREATE TABLE instantly_api_keys (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    api_key_encrypted TEXT NOT NULL, -- AES-256 encrypted
    api_key_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active', -- active, invalid, expired
    last_validated_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),

    UNIQUE(organization_id)
);

-- 2. Instantly Campaigns (mapping table)
CREATE TABLE instantly_campaigns (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    gmaps_campaign_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES gmaps_campaigns(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    -- Instantly campaign details
    instantly_campaign_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    instantly_campaign_name TEXT,

    -- Export metadata
    leads_exported INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    leads_failed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    export_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending', -- pending, in_progress, completed, failed

    -- Analytics (synced from Instantly API)
    leads_contacted INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_sent INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_opened INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_replied INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_clicked INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_bounced INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_unsubscribed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,

    -- Calculated metrics
    open_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
    reply_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
    click_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
    bounce_rate DECIMAL(5,2),

    -- Cost tracking
    cost_per_reply DECIMAL(10,2),

    -- Sync timestamps
    last_analytics_sync TIMESTAMPTZ,
    synced_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),

    UNIQUE(gmaps_campaign_id)
);

-- 3. Email Events (from webhooks)
CREATE TABLE instantly_email_events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    gmaps_campaign_id UUID REFERENCES gmaps_campaigns(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    instantly_campaign_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    -- Event details
    event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- email_sent, email_opened, reply_received, link_clicked, email_bounced
    lead_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email_account VARCHAR(255), -- Sender email account

    -- Event payload
    event_data JSONB NOT NULL, -- Raw webhook payload

    -- Metadata
    instantly_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ,
    received_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,

    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- 4. Export Logs (audit trail)
CREATE TABLE instantly_export_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    gmaps_campaign_id UUID REFERENCES gmaps_campaigns(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    -- Export attempt details
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- started, completed, failed
    leads_total INTEGER,
    leads_exported INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    leads_skipped INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    leads_failed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,

    -- Error tracking
    error_message TEXT,
    error_details JSONB,

    -- Timing
    started_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    duration_seconds INTEGER,

    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_instantly_campaigns_gmaps_campaign ON instantly_campaigns(gmaps_campaign_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_instantly_campaigns_org ON instantly_campaigns(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_instantly_campaigns_status ON instantly_campaigns(export_status);

CREATE INDEX idx_instantly_events_campaign ON instantly_email_events(gmaps_campaign_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_instantly_events_email ON instantly_email_events(lead_email);
CREATE INDEX idx_instantly_events_type ON instantly_email_events(event_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_instantly_events_processed ON instantly_email_events(processed);

CREATE INDEX idx_instantly_export_logs_campaign ON instantly_export_logs(gmaps_campaign_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_instantly_export_logs_org ON instantly_export_logs(organization_id);

-- Row Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE instantly_api_keys ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE instantly_campaigns ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE instantly_email_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE instantly_export_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policies (organization isolation)
CREATE POLICY "Users can access own org's API keys"
ON instantly_api_keys FOR ALL
USING (organization_id = current_setting('app.current_organization_id')::UUID);

CREATE POLICY "Users can access own org's campaigns"
ON instantly_campaigns FOR ALL
USING (organization_id = current_setting('app.current_organization_id')::UUID);

CREATE POLICY "Users can access own org's events"
ON instantly_email_events FOR ALL
USING (organization_id = current_setting('app.current_organization_id')::UUID);

CREATE POLICY "Users can access own org's logs"
ON instantly_export_logs FOR ALL
USING (organization_id = current_setting('app.current_organization_id')::UUID);
```

**Schema Modifications:**

```sql
-- Add email engagement tracking to gmaps_businesses
ALTER TABLE gmaps_businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
ALTER TABLE gmaps_businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_opened_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
ALTER TABLE gmaps_businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_replied_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
ALTER TABLE gmaps_businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_clicked_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
ALTER TABLE gmaps_businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reply_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE gmaps_businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_status VARCHAR(20); -- sent, opened, replied, bounced

CREATE INDEX idx_businesses_email_status ON gmaps_businesses(email_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_businesses_replied ON gmaps_businesses(email_replied_at) WHERE email_replied_at IS NOT NULL;
```

### 8.2 API Client Design

**instantly-client.js Service:**

```javascript
// services/instantly-client.js
const axios = require('axios');

class InstantlyClient {
  constructor(apiKey) {
    this.apiKey = apiKey;
    this.baseURL = 'https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2';
    this.client = axios.create({
      baseURL: this.baseURL,
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      timeout: 30000 // 30 second timeout
    });

    // Add retry interceptor
    this.setupRetryInterceptor();
  }

  setupRetryInterceptor() {
    this.client.interceptors.response.use(null, async (error) => {
      const config = error.config;

      // Retry on rate limit (429) or server errors (5xx)
      if ([429, 500, 502, 503, 504].includes(error.response?.status)) {
        config.__retryCount = config.__retryCount || 0;

        if (config.__retryCount < 3) {
          config.__retryCount++;
          const delay = Math.pow(2, config.__retryCount) * 1000; // Exponential backoff
          console.log(`Retry attempt ${config.__retryCount} after ${delay}ms`);
          await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
          return this.client.request(config);
        }
      }

      return Promise.reject(error);
    });
  }

  async createCampaign(campaignData) {
    // POST /api/v2/campaigns
    const response = await this.client.post('/campaigns', {
      name: campaignData.name,
      // Add other campaign settings
    });
    return response.data;
  }

  async addLeads(campaignId, leads) {
    // POST /api/v2/leads (bulk)
    // Note: Verify bulk endpoint exists, may need to iterate
    const response = await this.client.post('/leads', {
      campaign_id: campaignId,
      leads: leads
    });
    return response.data;
  }

  async addLeadsBatch(campaignId, leads, batchSize = 100) {
    // Split into batches to respect rate limits
    const results = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < leads.length; i += batchSize) {
      const batch = leads.slice(i, i + batchSize);
      const result = await this.addLeads(campaignId, batch);
      results.push(result);

      // Small delay between batches to avoid rate limits
      if (i + batchSize < leads.length) {
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
      }
    }
    return results;
  }

  async getCampaignAnalytics(campaignId) {
    // GET /api/v2/analytics
    const response = await this.client.get('/analytics', {
      params: { id: campaignId }
    });
    return response.data;
  }

  async validateApiKey() {
    // Test API key by fetching campaigns
    try {
      const response = await this.client.get('/campaigns', {
        params: { limit: 1 }
      });
      return { valid: true };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        valid: false,
        error: error.response?.data?.message || error.message
      };
    }
  }
}

module.exports = { InstantlyClient };
```

### 8.3 Background Job Architecture

**Option 1: Simple Polling (Node-Cron)**

```javascript
// jobs/analytics-sync-job.js
const cron = require('node-cron');
const { InstantlyClient } = require('../services/instantly-client');
const { supabase } = require('../supabase-db');

class AnalyticsSyncJob {
  constructor() {
    this.isRunning = false;
  }

  async syncAllCampaigns() {
    if (this.isRunning) {
      console.log('Sync already running, skipping...');
      return;
    }

    this.isRunning = true;
    console.log('Starting analytics sync job...');

    try {
      // Get all active Instantly campaigns
      const { data: campaigns, error } = await supabase
        .from('instantly_campaigns')
        .select('id, instantly_campaign_id, organization_id')
        .eq('export_status', 'completed')
        .order('last_analytics_sync', { ascending: true, nullsFirst: true })
        .limit(50); // Process 50 per job run

      if (error) throw error;

      for (const campaign of campaigns) {
        try {
          await this.syncCampaign(campaign);
        } catch (err) {
          console.error(`Failed to sync campaign ${campaign.id}:`, err.message);
        }
      }

      console.log(`Analytics sync completed for ${campaigns.length} campaigns`);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Analytics sync job failed:', error);
    } finally {
      this.isRunning = false;
    }
  }

  async syncCampaign(campaign) {
    // Get API key for organization
    const { data: apiKeyData } = await supabase
      .from('instantly_api_keys')
      .select('api_key_encrypted')
      .eq('organization_id', campaign.organization_id)
      .single();

    if (!apiKeyData) return;

    // Decrypt API key (implement encryption helper)
    const apiKey = decrypt(apiKeyData.api_key_encrypted);

    // Fetch analytics from Instantly
    const client = new InstantlyClient(apiKey);
    const analytics = await client.getCampaignAnalytics(campaign.instantly_campaign_id);

    // Update database
    await supabase
      .from('instantly_campaigns')
      .update({
        total_sent: analytics.contacted_count,
        total_opened: analytics.open_count,
        total_replied: analytics.reply_count,
        total_clicked: analytics.link_click_count,
        total_bounced: analytics.bounced_count,
        total_unsubscribed: analytics.unsubscribed_count,
        open_rate: analytics.contacted_count > 0
          ? (analytics.open_count / analytics.contacted_count * 100).toFixed(2)
          : 0,
        reply_rate: analytics.contacted_count > 0
          ? (analytics.reply_count / analytics.contacted_count * 100).toFixed(2)
          : 0,
        last_analytics_sync: new Date().toISOString()
      })
      .eq('id', campaign.id);
  }

  start() {
    // Run every hour
    cron.schedule('0 * * * *', () => {
      this.syncAllCampaigns();
    });

    // Also run immediately on startup
    this.syncAllCampaigns();

    console.log('Analytics sync job scheduled (every hour)');
  }
}

module.exports = { AnalyticsSyncJob };
```

**Start Job in server:**

```javascript
// simple-server.js (add to startup)
const { AnalyticsSyncJob } = require('./jobs/analytics-sync-job');

// Start analytics sync job
const analyticsSyncJob = new AnalyticsSyncJob();
analyticsSyncJob.start();
```

**Option 2: Job Queue (BullMQ) - Future Enhancement**
- More robust for high volume
- Better error handling and retry mechanisms
- Job prioritization and scheduling
- Consider for Phase 4 if needed

### 8.4 Webhook Architecture

**Webhook Receiver Endpoint:**

```javascript
// routes/webhooks.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const crypto = require('crypto');
const { supabase } = require('../supabase-db');

// Webhook signature validation (implement based on Instantly docs)
function validateWebhookSignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const computedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(JSON.stringify(payload))
    .digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(computedSignature)
  );
}

// POST /webhook/instantly
router.post('/instantly', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Respond quickly to Instantly (within 500ms requirement)
    res.status(200).json({ received: true });

    // Process webhook async
    processWebhook(req.body).catch(err => {
      console.error('Webhook processing error:', err);
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Webhook receiver error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
});

async function processWebhook(payload) {
  const {
    event_type,
    campaign_id,
    lead_email,
    timestamp,
    // ... other fields
  } = payload;

  // Find campaign by instantly_campaign_id
  const { data: campaign } = await supabase
    .from('instantly_campaigns')
    .select('id, gmaps_campaign_id, organization_id')
    .eq('instantly_campaign_id', campaign_id)
    .single();

  if (!campaign) {
    console.warn(`Campaign not found for instantly_campaign_id: ${campaign_id}`);
    return;
  }

  // Store raw event
  await supabase
    .from('instantly_email_events')
    .insert({
      gmaps_campaign_id: campaign.gmaps_campaign_id,
      instantly_campaign_id: campaign_id,
      organization_id: campaign.organization_id,
      event_type,
      lead_email,
      event_data: payload,
      instantly_timestamp: timestamp,
      processed: false
    });

  // Update business record
  await updateBusinessEmailStatus(campaign.gmaps_campaign_id, lead_email, event_type);

  // Increment analytics counters
  await incrementCampaignCounters(campaign.id, event_type);
}

async function updateBusinessEmailStatus(campaignId, email, eventType) {
  const updates = { email_status: eventType.replace('email_', '') };

  if (eventType === 'email_sent') {
    updates.email_sent_at = new Date().toISOString();
  } else if (eventType === 'email_opened') {
    updates.email_opened_at = new Date().toISOString();
  } else if (eventType === 'reply_received') {
    updates.email_replied_at = new Date().toISOString();
    updates.reply_count = supabase.sql`reply_count + 1`;
  } else if (eventType === 'link_clicked') {
    updates.email_clicked_at = new Date().toISOString();
  }

  await supabase
    .from('gmaps_businesses')
    .update(updates)
    .eq('campaign_id', campaignId)
    .eq('email', email);
}

async function incrementCampaignCounters(campaignId, eventType) {
  const counterMap = {
    'email_sent': 'total_sent',
    'email_opened': 'total_opened',
    'reply_received': 'total_replied',
    'link_clicked': 'total_clicked',
    'email_bounced': 'total_bounced'
  };

  const counterField = counterMap[event_type];
  if (!counterField) return;

  await supabase
    .from('instantly_campaigns')
    .update({
      [counterField]: supabase.sql`${counterField} + 1`
    })
    .eq('id', campaignId);
}

module.exports = router;
```

**Register in Express:**

```javascript
// simple-server.js
const webhooksRouter = require('./routes/webhooks');
app.use('/webhook', webhooksRouter);
```

### 8.5 Frontend Components

**InstantlySettings Component:**

```typescript
// frontend/src/components/settings/InstantlySettings.tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useMutation, useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

## 15. Conclusion

This integration plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for connecting the lead generation platform with Instantly.ai's email campaign automation service. By following the phased approach outlined here, the team can deliver a robust, reliable, and user-friendly integration that transforms the platform from a lead generation tool into a complete end-to-end outreach solution.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Hybrid Sync Architecture** - Combines push-on-demand export with pull-based analytics and real-time webhook notifications
2. **Phased Rollout** - Start with core export functionality, then add webhooks, then analytics
3. **Strong Technical Foundation** - Proper database schema, API client abstraction, background jobs
4. **User-Centric Design** - One-click export, clear feedback, easy configuration
5. **Resilient Implementation** - Retry logic, error handling, monitoring, rollback capability

The integration addresses the critical gap in the current platform (manual CSV export) and positions the product as a complete lead-to-reply solution. With proper execution, this feature will become a key differentiator and drive significant increases in user adoption, retention, and satisfaction.

**Estimated Timeline:**
- **Phase 1 (Foundation):** 2 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Webhooks):** 2 weeks
