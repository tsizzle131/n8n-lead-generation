## Use Cases

### Development Testing
```bash
# After making database schema changes
./run_database_verification_test.sh

# Check that all save operations still work
# Verify foreign keys intact
# Ensure no regressions
```

### Pre-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Before merging to main
./run_database_verification_test.sh

# Ensure 100% pass rate
# Check coverage percentages
# Validate export completeness
```

### Production Health Check
```bash
# Regular verification
./run_database_verification_test.sh

# Verify data integrity
# Check verification rates
# Monitor enrichment coverage
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
- name: Database Verification
  run: python3 test_database_verification_complete.py

# Fails build if tests fail
# Generates test report artifact
```

## Customization

### Test Different Campaign
Edit line 32 in `test_database_verification_complete.py`:
```python
self.campaign_name = "Your Campaign Name"
```

### Test More Businesses
Edit line 86:
```python
LIMIT 10  # Change to 20, 50, etc.
```

### Add Custom Tests
See `DATABASE_VERIFICATION_TEST_README.md` for detailed instructions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Could not find campaign"**
- Check campaign name matches exactly
- View available campaigns in output
- Update `campaign_name` variable

**"No businesses found without LinkedIn enrichment"**
- Campaign already fully enriched
- Use different campaign
- Modify query to re-test existing enrichments

**Scraper runs but no data saved**
- Check `save_linkedin_enrichment()` implementation
- Verify database credentials
- Check Supabase connection

**Missing campaign_id in records**
- Check parameter passing in scraper
- Verify `campaign_id` included in save calls
- Check database triggers/defaults

**Orphaned records found**
- Check foreign key constraints
- Verify delete cascades configured
- Review business deletion logic

## Performance

### Expected Duration
- Setup: ~2 seconds
- LinkedIn scraping: ~10-15 minutes (10 businesses)
- Database queries: ~5 seconds per test
- Report generation: ~2 seconds
- **Total: ~20 minutes**

### Optimization Options
```python
# Reduce scraping time
LIMIT 5  # Test with fewer businesses

# Reduce concurrent scraping
max_concurrent=2  # Lower concurrency

# Skip LinkedIn scraping if already tested
# Comment out test_linkedin_parallel_scraper()
```

## Integration Points

### Connects With
- `GmapsSupabaseManager` - Database operations
- `linkedin_scraper_parallel.py` - LinkedIn enrichment
- Supabase database - All tables
- Apify API - Scraping services
- Bouncer API - Email verification

### Validates
- Database schema correctness
- Scraper save implementations
- Foreign key relationships
- Campaign_id propagation
- Email verification pipeline
- CSV export queries

## Success Criteria

### 100% Pass Rate Required For
- Production deployment
- Main branch merge
- Release tagging
- Database migration approval

### Acceptable Failure Scenarios
- Data-dependent issues (e.g., no Facebook URLs to test)
- Rate limiting during test (re-run resolves)
- Temporary API outages (re-run resolves)

### Unacceptable Failures
- Orphaned records
- Missing campaign_id
- Scraper saves nothing
- Foreign key violations
- Missing verification sources

## Next Steps

### After Tests Pass
1. Review verification coverage percentages
2. Check deliverable email rates
3. Run actual campaign export
4. Monitor production campaigns
5. Schedule regular test runs

### After Tests Fail
1. Review failed test details in output
2. Check JSON report for full data
3. Identify root cause
4. Create Linear issue with test results
5. Fix issues
6. Re-run test to verify fix
7. Update documentation if needed

## Support & Documentation

### Quick Reference
- **Quick Start:** `QUICK_TEST_GUIDE.md`
- **Full Docs:** `DATABASE_VERIFICATION_TEST_README.md`
- **Visual Flow:** `TEST_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md`
- **Sample Output:** `SAMPLE_TEST_OUTPUT.md`

### For Help
1. Check documentation files above
2. Review console output errors
3. Check JSON report file
4. Verify database schema in Supabase
5. Check scraper logs
6. Create Linear issue with:
   - Test output
   - JSON report
   - Error messages
   - Expected vs actual results
