# Backend Campaign Execution Debug Report

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Time:** 19:30 UTC
**Investigator:** Claude Code

## Executive Summary

Found **CRITICAL BUG**: 3 campaigns stuck in "running" status with no processes executing them. The campaigns completed execution but status was never updated to "completed".

---

## Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Stuck Campaigns - No Status Update

**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** User cannot see completed campaigns, export data appears unavailable

**Evidence:**

3 campaigns stuck in `status = 'running'`:

1. **Campaign:** `END-TO-END TEST - 20251010-150600`
   - **ID:** `c60fdb55-a06e-4c57-af29-2468e805b792`
   - **Started:** 2025-10-10T15:06:01
   - **Last Updated:** 2025-10-10T19:08:20 (242 minutes runtime)
   - **Stuck for:** 0.4 hours
   - **Business Found:** 10
   - **Cost Tracked:** $0.08

2. **Campaign:** `DIAGNOSTIC TEST - Yorktown Heights Restaurants`
   - **ID:** `dd820d6a-477f-46bc-8bc5-0765949cf93a`
   - **Started:** 2025-10-10T04:00:39
   - **Last Updated:** 2025-10-10T08:03:36 (242 minutes runtime)
   - **Stuck for:** 11.4 hours
   - **Business Found:** 10
   - **Cost Tracked:** $0.08

3. **Campaign:** `Apify Test - Single ZIP`
   - **ID:** `10c8dad1-d32d-47c2-9ef8-2358c25f4350`
   - **Started:** 2025-10-09T23:08:59
   - **Last Updated:** 2025-10-09T23:08:59 (0 minutes runtime)
   - **Stuck for:** 20.3 hours
   - **Business Found:** 0

**Root Cause Analysis:**

1. **Python campaign manager execution completes successfully**
   - Evidence: Campaigns have `total_businesses_found` > 0
   - Evidence: API costs are tracked (`actual_cost`, `google_maps_cost`, `facebook_cost`)
   - Evidence: `updated_at` timestamps show progress during execution

2. **Status update to "completed" never happens**
   - File: `/Users/tristanwaite/n8n test/lead_generation/modules/gmaps_campaign_manager.py`
   - Line 569-576: Code DOES update status to "completed"
   - **Hypothesis:** Python process crashes or exits before reaching line 569

3. **Possible failure points:**
   - Phase 2 Facebook enrichment (lines 279-448)
   - Phase 2.5 LinkedIn enrichment (lines 450-566)
   - Exception caught but campaign not marked as failed
   - Process killed externally (timeout, OOM, user interrupt)

### Issue #2: Missing API Endpoint

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Frontend cannot fetch campaigns via `/api/campaigns`

**Evidence:**
```
$ curl http://localhost:5001/api/campaigns
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Error</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>Cannot GET /api/campaigns</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

**Root Cause:**
- Endpoint exists at `/campaigns` (line 1993 in simple-server.js)
- Frontend may be calling wrong endpoint `/api/campaigns`
- Correct endpoint: `/api/gmaps/campaigns` (line 2609)

**Working endpoint:**
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:5001/api/gmaps/campaigns
# Returns campaign data successfully
```

---

### Issue #3: Database Schema Mismatch

**Severity:** LOW (informational)
**Impact:** Test scripts fail with schema errors

**Evidence:**
```python
# From end_to_end_test_results.log:
postgrest.exceptions.APIError: {'message': "Could not find the 'location_type' column of 'gmaps_campaigns' in the schema cache", 'code': 'PGRST204'}
```

**Root Cause:**
- Test script tries to insert `location_type` column
- Column doesn't exist in current schema
- Old test scripts not updated for new schema

## Server Status

### Backend Processes Running

‚úÖ **Express Backend (simple-server.js)** - Port 5001
- PID: 49076
- Status: Running
- Uptime: Active since 10:40 PM

‚úÖ **React Frontend** - Port 3000
- PID: 39768
- Status: Running
- Multiple TypeScript checker processes active

‚ùå **No Python campaign processes running**
- Expected: 0 (campaigns should have completed)
- Actual: 0 ‚úì

---

## Database State

**Campaign Status Distribution:**
```
running: 3 campaigns (STUCK)
completed: 16 campaigns
draft: 2 campaigns
```

**Stuck Campaign Details:**

All 3 stuck campaigns show signs of partial completion:
- Have `total_businesses_found` populated
- Have `actual_cost` tracked
- Have enrichment costs (`google_maps_cost`, `facebook_cost`)
- Have recent `updated_at` timestamps during execution
- Missing `completed_at` timestamp
- Status never changed from "running" to "completed"

---

## Code Analysis

### Python Campaign Manager Status Update Logic

**File:** `/Users/tristanwaite/n8n test/lead_generation/modules/gmaps_campaign_manager.py`

**Lines 568-576:**
```python
# Update campaign with final results
self.db.update_campaign(campaign_id, {
    "status": "completed",
    "completed_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "actual_cost": total_cost,
    "total_businesses_found": total_businesses,
    "total_emails_found": total_emails,
    "total_facebook_pages_found": total_facebook_pages
})
```

**Lines 603-612 (Error Handler):**
```python
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error executing campaign: {e}")

    # Update campaign status to failed
    self.db.update_campaign(campaign_id, {
        "status": "failed",
        "completed_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
    })

    return {"error": str(e)}
```

**Analysis:**
- Code looks correct
- Has proper error handling
- Should mark campaigns as "completed" or "failed"
- **Bug:** Something prevents execution from reaching these lines

---

## Hypothesis: Phase 2.5 LinkedIn Timeout

**Evidence from code:**
1. Campaign #1: Last update 19:08:20 (after 242 minutes)
2. Campaign #2: Last update 08:03:36 (after 242 minutes)
3. Both campaigns show EXACTLY 242 minutes runtime

**242 minutes = 4 hours 2 minutes**

**Analysis:**
- Campaigns update database during execution (Phase 1, Phase 2)
- Progress stops at Phase 2.5 (LinkedIn enrichment)
- Lines 450-566 in gmaps_campaign_manager.py
- Possible timeout or rate limit issue
- Process dies silently without marking campaign complete

**Evidence from logs:**
```
end_to_end_test_results.log shows:
  ‚úì Phase 1: Google Maps scraping
  ‚úì Phase 2: Facebook enrichment (3 passes)
  ‚úì Phase 2.5: LinkedIn enrichment

Then crashes with schema error (but this was old test run)
```

---

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix #1: Add Campaign Timeout Handler (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Campaigns run indefinitely if Phase 2.5 hangs

**Solution:** Add timeout monitoring in simple-server.js

```javascript
// In simple-server.js around line 2810
const CAMPAIGN_TIMEOUT_MS = 4 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 4 hours

setTimeout(async () => {
  try {
    const campaign = await gmapsCampaigns.getById(campaignId);
    if (campaign && campaign.status === 'running') {
      console.error(`Campaign ${campaignId} timed out after 4 hours`);
      await gmapsCampaigns.update(campaignId, {
        status: 'completed', // or 'failed' if no results
        completed_at: new Date().toISOString(),
        error: 'Campaign execution timed out after 4 hours'
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error handling campaign timeout:', error);
  }
}, CAMPAIGN_TIMEOUT_MS);
```

### Fix #2: Manual Cleanup Script for Stuck Campaigns

**File:** `/Users/tristanwaite/n8n test/fix_stuck_campaigns.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Fix stuck campaigns that have businesses but status=running
"""
from supabase import create_client
import json
from datetime import datetime

# Load credentials
with open('.app-state.json', 'r') as f:
    state = json.load(f)

supabase = create_client(state['supabase']['url'], state['supabase']['key'])

# Find stuck campaigns
response = supabase.table('gmaps_campaigns')\
    .select('*')\
    .eq('status', 'running')\
    .execute()

stuck_campaigns = response.data

for campaign in stuck_campaigns:
    campaign_id = campaign['id']
    name = campaign['name']
    businesses = campaign.get('total_businesses_found', 0)

    # If campaign has results, mark as completed
    if businesses > 0:
        print(f"Marking campaign '{name}' as completed ({businesses} businesses)")
        supabase.table('gmaps_campaigns')\
            .update({
                'status': 'completed',
                'completed_at': datetime.now().isoformat()
            })\
            .eq('id', campaign_id)\
            .execute()
    else:
        # No results, mark as failed
        print(f"Marking campaign '{name}' as failed (no businesses)")
        supabase.table('gmaps_campaigns')\
            .update({
                'status': 'failed',
                'completed_at': datetime.now().isoformat(),
                'error': 'Campaign stuck with no results'
            })\
            .eq('id', campaign_id)\
            .execute()

print("\\nDone! Fixed all stuck campaigns.")
```

### Fix #3: Fix API Endpoint Path

**Problem:** `/api/campaigns` doesn't exist

**Solution:** Add endpoint at expected path or update frontend

**Option A - Add new endpoint:**
```javascript
// In simple-server.js after line 2618
app.get('/api/campaigns', async (req, res) => {
  console.log('üìç Fetching Google Maps campaigns (via /api/campaigns)');
  try {
    const campaigns = await gmapsCampaigns.getAll();
    res.json({ campaigns });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching campaigns:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch campaigns' });
  }
});
```

**Option B - Frontend fix:**
Change frontend API calls from `/api/campaigns` to `/api/gmaps/campaigns`

---

## Testing Plan

1. **Run cleanup script to fix stuck campaigns**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/tristanwaite/n8n\ test
   python3 fix_stuck_campaigns.py
   ```

2. **Verify campaigns are marked complete**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5001/api/gmaps/campaigns | jq '.campaigns[] | select(.status=="running")'
   # Should return empty
   ```

3. **Test campaign execution with timeout**
   - Create new test campaign
   - Monitor for 5 hours
   - Verify timeout handler works

4. **Test API endpoint fix**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5001/api/campaigns
   # Should return campaigns, not 404
   ```

---

## Conclusion

**Root cause identified:** Campaigns complete data collection but fail to update status to "completed". Most likely due to Phase 2.5 LinkedIn enrichment timeout or crash.

**Immediate action:** Run `fix_stuck_campaigns.py` to clean up the 3 stuck campaigns.

**Long-term fix:** Add timeout handler and improve error handling in LinkedIn enrichment phase.

**Impact:** User experience degraded - campaigns appear stuck even though data is available for export.
