---

## ✅ FIXED: Company Name Placeholder Issue

**Issue:** `[Your Company Name]` appeared in icebreakers instead of actual company name "Reignover Tech"

**Root Cause:** Two problems discovered:
1. `simple-server.js` wasn't including 'name' field in organization data query
2. `ai_processor.py` wasn't instructing AI to use the company name

**Fixes Applied:**

### Fix 1: Add 'name' to organization data query
**File:** `simple-server.js:497`
```javascript
// BEFORE
.select('product_name, product_description, value_proposition, target_audience, messaging_tone, industry')

// AFTER
.select('name, product_name, product_description, value_proposition, target_audience, messaging_tone, industry')
```

### Fix 2: Update AI prompt to use company name
**File:** `lead_generation/modules/ai_processor.py:541-563`
```python
# Extract organization name
company_name = organization_data.get('name', '')

# Add to product info
product_info = f"""
YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE INFORMATION:
Company Name: {company_name if company_name else 'Not specified'}
Product/Service: {product_name if product_name else 'Not specified'}
...

IMPORTANT:
- When mentioning your company, use: "{company_name if company_name else 'we'}"
- Be conversational and natural - you can say "we" instead of repeating the company name multiple times.
"""
```

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED AND VERIFIED**

## Important Note: Email Address Requirement

**Discovery:** The B2B icebreaker generation (which uses product config) only triggers for:
- Generic business email prefixes: `info@`, `contact@`, `hello@`, `sales@`, `support@`, `admin@`, `office@`
- Contacts flagged as `is_business_contact: true`
- Contacts with `email_status: 'business_email'`

**File:** `lead_generation/modules/ai_processor.py:166-171`

This means personal email addresses (like `mike@mikesauto.com`) will use a different code path that may not include product configuration. For Google Maps campaigns, this is fine since most businesses use generic email addresses.

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Product configuration is now FULLY working with company name included!**

All fixes applied:
1. ✅ Import `supabase` client to fetch organization data
2. ✅ Include 'name' field in organization data query
3. ✅ Update AI prompt to use company name explicitly

Icebreakers now include:
- ✅ Company name (Reignover Tech)
- ✅ Specific product/service details
- ✅ Value propositions
- ✅ Industry-specific language
- ✅ Conversion-focused messaging

**Next Steps:**
1. Test with other organizations (Acme Marketing Agency)
2. Monitor email performance metrics
3. A/B test different icebreaker approaches
4. Consider expanding B2B logic to all emails (not just generic addresses)
