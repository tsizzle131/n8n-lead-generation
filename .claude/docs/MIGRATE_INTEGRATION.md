# /migrate Command - Organization File Integration

**Completed:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** ✅ Fully Integrated with TODO/STATUS/ROADMAP
**Command File:** `.claude/commands/migrate.md` (960 lines → 1,090 lines)

---

## 🎯 What Was Integrated

Successfully integrated **automatic organization file tracking** into the `/migrate` command so that TODO.md, STATUS.md, and ROADMAP.md stay **automatically synchronized** during framework and dependency migrations.

### Changes Made:

1. **Added Wave 0: Context & Organization Check** (lines 32-122)
   - Reads TODO.md for active migration tasks and blockers
   - Reads STATUS.md for test coverage baseline and recent migration work
   - Reads ROADMAP.md for migration priorities and strategic alignment
   - Extracts context summary to inform migration execution

2. **Added Wave 0.5: Update Tracking - Migration Started** (lines 90-122)
   - Marks TODO item as `[▶]` in progress
   - Adds migration to STATUS.md "Active Migrations" section
   - Records migration start with risk level (TBD after Wave 2)

3. **Added Wave 7: Update Organization Files & Summary** (lines 772-959)
   - Updates TODO.md: Marks complete, adds follow-up tasks
   - Updates STATUS.md: Records detailed migration results and quality metrics
   - Updates ROADMAP.md: Updates phase progress if migration was phase objective
   - Generates comprehensive integrated summary report

4. **Updated execution instruction** (line 959)
   - Changed from "Begin with Wave 1" to "Begin with Wave 0: Context & Organization Check"

5. **Updated wave count** (line 28)
   - Changed from "6-wave" to "7-wave parallel agent execution pattern"

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Before Migration (/migrate command):

**Wave 0: Context Check**
1. Reads TODO.md → Finds migration tasks, priorities, blockers
2. Reads STATUS.md → Checks test coverage baseline, recent migration work
3. Reads ROADMAP.md → Understands migration priority and strategic goals

**Wave 0.5: Start Tracking**
1. Marks TODO item as `[▶]` in progress
2. Adds migration to STATUS.md "Active Migrations" section

### During Migration:

Waves 1-6 execute normally with full context awareness:
- Wave 1: Discovery & Analysis
- Wave 2: Risk Assessment & Planning (with validation)
- Wave 3: Pre-Migration Preparation
- Wave 4: Migration Implementation (with validation)
- Wave 5: Post-Migration Validation (with validation)
- Wave 6: Documentation & Reporting

### After Migration:

**Wave 7: Organization File Updates**
1. **TODO.md** - Marks migration complete `[x]`, adds follow-up tasks
2. **STATUS.md** - Records detailed results, validation scores, quality metrics
3. **ROADMAP.md** - Updates phase progress if migration was a phase objective

**Final Output:**
- Comprehensive migration summary with organization file updates
- Strategic alignment with ROADMAP
- Complete audit trail in STATUS.md
- Next steps from TODO.md

## 📊 Benefits of Integration

### Automatic Migration Tracking

✅ **Context-Aware Planning** - Migration understands project phase and priorities
✅ **Baseline Tracking** - Captures test coverage and quality metrics before migration
✅ **Progress Visibility** - Real-time status in STATUS.md
✅ **Complete Audit Trail** - All migration results documented automatically
✅ **Strategic Alignment** - Migrations align with ROADMAP phase goals

### Enhanced Migration Decisions

✅ **Informed Risk Assessment** - Considers project context when evaluating risk
✅ **Priority-Based Execution** - High-priority migrations from TODO get precedence
✅ **Blocker Awareness** - Identifies blockers before starting migration
✅ **Related Work Context** - References past migrations for lessons learned

### Better Project Visibility

✅ **One Command, Full Tracking** - Just run `/migrate react 18`
✅ **Integrated Summaries** - See migration results + organization updates
✅ **Automatic TODO Updates** - Follow-up tasks added automatically
✅ **Phase Progress Tracking** - ROADMAP shows migration contribution

---

## 🎯 Integration Example

### Before Integration:

```bash
/migrate react 18

# Then manually:
# 1. Open TODO.md and mark task as complete
# 2. Add follow-up tasks from migration report
# 3. Open STATUS.md and add migration results
# 4. Update quality metrics manually
# 5. Open ROADMAP.md and update phase progress
# 6. Calculate if migration completed phase objective
```

### After Integration:

```bash
/migrate react 18

# Automatically:
# ✓ Reads TODO/STATUS/ROADMAP for context
# ✓ Marks TODO as in-progress [▶]
# ✓ Executes migration with full context
# ✓ Updates TODO: [▶] → [x], adds follow-up tasks
# ✓ Records complete results in STATUS.md
# ✓ Updates ROADMAP phase progress
# ✓ Shows integrated summary
```

**Result:** 1 command instead of 6+ manual steps!

## 📋 What Each Wave Does

### Wave 0: Context & Organization Check (NEW)

**Purpose:** Understand project before starting migration

**Reads:**
- TODO.md → Active migration tasks, blockers, priorities
- STATUS.md → Test coverage baseline, recent migrations
- ROADMAP.md → Migration priority, strategic goals, prerequisites

**Extracts:**
```
Organization Context:
- Current Phase: Phase 1 - Infrastructure Commands
- Migration Priority: High (from ROADMAP)
- Active Migration Tasks: None
- Blockers: None
- Test Coverage Baseline: 10% manual
- Related Migrations: None yet
- Strategic Alignment: Phase 1 infrastructure modernization
- Prerequisites: None
```

**Output:** Context summary for migration execution

---

### Wave 0.5: Update Tracking - Migration Started (NEW)

**Purpose:** Mark migration as in-progress

**Updates:**
- TODO.md: `[ ]` → `[▶]` (in progress marker)
- STATUS.md: Adds to "Active Migrations" section

**Example TODO.md Update:**
```markdown
## 🔥 In Progress
- [▶] Migrate React to version 18 (Started: 2025-10-12 14:30)
  - Migration type: Framework
  - Risk level: TBD (assessed in Wave 2)
  - Phase: Phase 1 - Infrastructure Commands
  - Estimated: 2-6 hours
```

**Example STATUS.md Update:**
```markdown
## 🔄 Active Migrations

## 🧩 Migration-Specific Integration Benefits

### 1. Risk-Aware Execution

**Without Integration:**
- Migration doesn't know project's test coverage
- Can't assess if migration timing is appropriate
- No context on related migrations

**With Integration:**
- Reads test coverage from STATUS.md (10% = high risk)
- Checks ROADMAP for migration priority and timing
- References past migration approaches from STATUS.md
- Adjusts validation thresholds based on context

---

### 2. Validation Baseline Tracking

**Without Integration:**
- Must manually note test counts before migration
- No historical quality metric comparison
- Can't track migration impact on project health

**With Integration:**
- Automatically captures baseline from STATUS.md
- Compares before/after test results (120 → 122 tests)
- Updates quality metrics in STATUS.md (+2% coverage)
- Tracks long-term migration quality trends

---

### 3. Phase Progress Tracking

**Without Integration:**
- ROADMAP says "Phase 1: 25%"
- Manual calculation needed to update
- No connection between migration and phase goals

**With Integration:**
- Migration completes, phase auto-updates to 50%
- Clear link between migration and phase objective
- Progress toward phase completion visible
- Strategic value of migration documented

---

### 4. Follow-Up Task Management

**Migration finds:** "3 deprecated lifecycle methods still in use"

**Without Integration:**
- User must remember to create TODO items
- May forget specific file locations
- No link back to migration report

**With Integration:**
- Automatically adds to TODO.md with context
- Links back to MIGRATION.md for details
- Prioritizes based on criticality
- Preserves all context for follow-up work

---

## 🎉 Impact

### Before:
- Migrations execute in isolation
- Manual tracking of results required
- No baseline comparison
- Easy to lose migration context
- Organization files become stale

### After:
- Migrations are context-aware
- Automatic result tracking
- Complete before/after metrics
- Full audit trail maintained
- Organization files always current

### Result:
**Self-organizing migration system** that maintains complete project visibility and strategic alignment automatically!

- [ ] `/optimize` - Medium priority (should track performance metrics in STATUS)
- [ ] `/bughunter` - Medium priority (should track bugs found/fixed in STATUS)
- [ ] `/document` - Low priority (should update documentation coverage in STATUS)
- [ ] `/explain` - Low priority (informational, minimal tracking needed)

### Testing Needed:
- [ ] Test /migrate with existing TODO/STATUS/ROADMAP
- [ ] Test /migrate without organization files (graceful degradation)
- [ ] Verify phase progress calculations are correct
- [ ] Test multiple migrations in sequence (no conflicts)
- [ ] Validate baseline tracking accuracy
