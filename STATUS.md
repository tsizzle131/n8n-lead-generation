## 📈 Project Health

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Comprehensive risk analysis completed (12 edge cases, 5 critical risks)
- ✅ Clear mitigation strategies for all identified risks
- ✅ Low rollback risk with feature flag approach
- ✅ No schema changes required (additive only)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- ⚠️ Performance impact requires optimization (batch cost tracking critical)
- ⚠️ Breaking changes require code updates in 2 backends
- ⚠️ Row locking may cause throughput reduction without batching

**Immediate Priorities:**
1. Implement batch cost tracking (CRITICAL - prevents 10x throughput loss)
2. Fix empty array handling in stored functions (HIGH - prevents failures)
3. Implement smart business upsert (HIGH - prevents data loss)
4. Data cleanup before deployment (MEDIUM - prevents FK violations)
